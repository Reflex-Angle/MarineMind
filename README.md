# MarineMind

## Marine Animal Species Recognition
An AI model development to aid in marine research and explore the life in the seas below

## Motivation
Marine biology is a crucial field in the scientific research of flora, fauna and its evolution. As of 2022, about 242,000 marine species living in the world's oceans have been identified. Marine biota continue to be discovered about 2,332 new species per year.

- How can we develop an AI driven machine learning model to identify and classify different marine species from underwater images? 


## Objective
The objective is to create an automated system that can accurately recognize various species of marine life from images captured in underwater environments, assisting researchers and conservationists in monitoring and studying marine biodiversity.

## Result
To showcase our model's capability to aid in research involving pictures taken at extreme environments, we take test images of low clarity taken at great depths and perhaps other interferences in the image.
